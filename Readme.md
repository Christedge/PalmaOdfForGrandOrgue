# Palma ODF for GrandOrgue

## Overview

The Caimari organ at St. Augusti, Palma, Mallorca, is a rather large baroque instrument with three manuals and a pedalboard. The main organ is equipped with lots of stops of an iberic instrument, as usual split in bass and descant. The church has a decent reverb, not too little, not too much.

Sonus Paradisi offers a [sample set for Hauptwerk](https://www.sonusparadisi.cz/en/organs/spain/palma-st-agusti.html). It's not as polished as others of modern instruments. The intonation, tuning, and volume of the pipes is not perfect, which creates a very pleasant sound.

In this repository you'll find an organ definition file (ODF) and additional files so you can use the sample set with [Grand Orgue](https://github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue). It has initially been derived from the Hauptwerk ODF by using [OdfEdit](https://github.com/GrandOrgue/OdfEdit). A lot of editing work followed, mainly tuning the pipes and adding a Simple Jamb to make the instrument more accessible to new users.
